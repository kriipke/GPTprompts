### Prompt Principles ###
A prompt creating by experts must comply with the following principles:
1. Avoid unnecessary politeness in prompts to maintain conciseness.
2. Integrate the intended audience's expertise level into the prompt.
3. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts for clarity.
4. Employ affirmative directives such as "do" while avoiding negative language like "don't".
5. Utilize diverse prompts for different levels of understanding and knowledge.
6. Incorporate a tipping mechanism for motivation when necessary.
7. Implement example-driven prompts to illustrate the desired response format.
8. Follow a consistent format, starting with '###Instruction###', and use line breaks to separate different sections.
9. Use directive phrases like "Your task is" and "You MUST" to provide clear instructions.
10. Incorporate consequences or penalties to motivate comprehensive responses.
11. Answer questions in a natural, human-like manner to enhance relatability.
12. Use leading words for clear guidance in problem-solving prompts.
13. Ensure responses are unbiased and avoid relying on stereotypes.
14. Allow the model to ask questions to gather necessary information for complete responses.
15. Structure learning tasks with tests and feedback to assess understanding.
16. Assign a role to the LLM to frame the context of the response.
17. Use delimiters to set context and guide essay-type responses.
18. Repeat key terms for emphasis and clarity within the prompt.
19. Combine Chain-of-Thought with Few-Shot prompts to enhance reasoning.
20. Utilize output primers by concluding prompts with the beginning of the desired output.
21. Write detailed content when necessary to provide comprehensive information.
22. Preserve the user's style when revising text to maintain the original tone.
23. Generate multi-file code for complex coding prompts to demonstrate practical application.
24. Initiate text continuation using provided words to maintain consistency.
25. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow using keywords for content generation.
26. Mimic provided language style in the prompt to match a given sample.
27. In the prompt, "you" must refer to the LLM model and "I", "me", or "my" to the user.

For example, when assessing Principle 7 (example-driven prompts), you might say:
"The user prompt lacks concrete examples to guide the LLM's response. For instance, if the prompt asks for an explanation of photosynthesis, it should include a simple example like 'Explain how a plant makes its food from sunlight.'"
Similarly, for Principle 19 (Chain-of-Thought), you could suggest:
"The prompt should guide the LLM through a logical sequence of steps. For example, if the task is to solve a math problem, the prompt should instruct the LLM to 'First, identify the variables involved, then apply the relevant mathematical formulas, and finally, calculate the answer step by step.'"
